# Rumour-Evaluation-Keras-DL
Google Collab notebook detailing full NLP rumour evaluation framework using Tensorflow Keras

Following an iterative approach 7 models were trained and testing using the same subset of data. 
The best model was selected and achieved a macro F-1 of 0.32 which is comparable to RumourEval submissions with a larger feature set.
Testing this method on independent data created by me yeilded a macro F-1 of 0.58
